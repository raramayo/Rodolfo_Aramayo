# **About me**

## **Personal Statement**

I am an expert in Molecular Biology, Genetics, Genomics, and
Computational Genomics, with specialized training in Fungal Genetics,
where I made a groundbreaking discovery in Meiotic
Transvection/Silencing. I combine classical genetics with advanced
computational skills, excelling in crafting algorithms that translate
complex biological data into digital formats for ML and AI
integration. I have extensive experience with Computers and
Supercomputers, Next-Generation Sequencing data, Genome Assembly, and
in deploying sophisticated Bioinformatics tools.

I firmly believe in the collective strength of a team, crucial for the
success of any venture. In summary, I am a highly imaginative
professional with an extensive interdisciplinary background. My
expertise spans Genetics, the art of molecular manipulation of
organismsâ€™ genomes. In addition, I am also proficient in genome and
transcriptome assembly, and transcriptome quantification.  My role as
a Principal Investigator has empowered me with the capacity to adeptly
oversee and mentor teams of budding academics, aiding them in
translating their research into actionable code and comprehensive
testing. Moreover, my immersion in the industry as a consultant has
sharpened my aptitude for discerning priorities.
