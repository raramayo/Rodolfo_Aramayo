# **About me**

## **Personal Statement**

I am an expert in Molecular Biology, Genetics, Genomics, and Computational Genomics, with
specialized training in Fungal Genetics. My research has led to groundbreaking discoveries in
meiotic transvection and gene silencing mechanisms involving the model organism *Neurospora*
*crassa*. Additionally, my experience extends to working extensively with other important model
organisms, including *Aspergillus nidulans* and *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.

Leveraging my unique integration of classical genetics and molecular biology with advanced
computational techniques, I have developed novel algorithms and workflows capable of transforming
complex biological datasets into digital formats optimized for machine learning and artificial
intelligence applications. My proficiency includes extensive hands-on experience with
next-generation sequencing (NGS), genome and transcriptome assembly, transcriptome quantification,
and deployment of state-of-the-art bioinformatics software tools on both local computational
resources and high-performance supercomputers.

Recently, my skillset has expanded significantly through extensive engagement in AI interaction
engineering, prompt engineering, and AI annotation and training. I have honed my ability to
precisely define complex problems, craft sophisticated prompts, and iteratively improve interactions
with advanced AI models to achieve highly accurate and efficient results. Furthermore, my practical
experience in annotating datasets and training AI models has positioned me uniquely at the
intersection of biological sciences and artificial intelligence.

As a Principal Investigator, I have successfully managed and mentored interdisciplinary teams,
guiding junior researchers to convert theoretical insights into actionable, rigorously tested
computational solutions. My consultancy background has refined my strategic ability to prioritize
tasks effectively and efficiently.

In summary, I am a forward-thinking, innovative professional whose expertise bridges the fields of
molecular biology, genomics, computational biology, and artificial intelligence, making me uniquely
suited to drive advances at the forefront of AI-driven biological research.
