# **About me**

## **Personal Statement**

I am an expert in Molecular Biology, Genetics, Genomics, and
Computational Genomics, with specialized training in Fungal
Genetics. My research has led to a groundbreaking discovery in meiotic
transvection/silencing involving _Neurospora crassa_. I also have
extensive experience working with other model organisms such as
_Aspergillus nidulans_ and _Saccharomyces cerevisiae_.

Combining classical genetics and molecular biology with advanced
computational skills, I excel in crafting algorithms that translate
complex biological data into digital formats suitable for machine
learning and AI integration. I have extensive experience with
computers and supercomputers, next-generation sequencing data, genome
and transcriptome assembly, transcriptome quantification, and
deploying sophisticated bioinformatics tools.

As a Principal Investigator, I have adeptly overseen and mentored
teams of budding academics, aiding them in translating their research
into actionable code and comprehensive testing. I firmly believe in
the collective strength of a team, which is crucial for the success of
any venture.

My immersion in the industry as a consultant has sharpened my aptitude
for discerning priorities. In summary, I am a highly imaginative
professional with an extensive interdisciplinary background, whose
expertise spans the art of molecular manipulation of organismsâ€™
genomes and computational genomics.
